# Spring boot 2 SOAP service tutorial

## Client specifications
Imagine that your client client streamflix wants to create a SOAP service based on a service description (schema), by providing basic user information it will return a list of messages or client offers that the business needs to attract new clients but also offer promotions based on specific dates.

## Creating our promotion service
Clone this repository and follow [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@marcojcapo/first-stop-a-soap-service-dd3498ad338d) to get detailed information of this system.
I will describe the main files on every section while we move through each part of this tutorial, you will find a link to the class file next to the topic.

Use this project as a base template to build and customize it as it suits you. Also, I’m assuming it’s not your first time with java, but you can ask me whatever you want.

## What you will see in code
* Base SOAP project or a platform to build your first SOAP service.
* A better example of spring boot and its components.
* How to make your unit and integration tests
* Use of JUnit 5 with parameterized tests.
* Package your service for delivery with Docker.
* How to handle properties production ready.

## Pre-requirements
* Get Java 8
* Have Gradle 4+
* Git installed
* Docker up and running
* Lastly, an IDE of your choice; I’m currently using Visual Studio Code
